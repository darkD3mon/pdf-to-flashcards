°12 Microcontroller A  microcontroller is a  small ,  low power  computer . Sometimes it is also just  called controller or board . A  microcontroller contains one or more CPUs ( processor cores )  along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals . Pins  for General  Purpose Input  and Output (GPIO). Embedded  systems typically use a  microprocessor as components . Source:  Amberg (2019) 
Input and Output (GPIO) pins. GPIOs allow a controller to measure and °13    control. Measuring =  reading  sensor values from  input  pins.  Controlling =  writing  actuator values to  output pins Source:  Amberg (2019)

Sensors & Actuators°28   – 
Sensors & Actuators°29   “A sensor is a device that responds to a physical stimulus (such as heat, light, sound, pressure, magnetism, or a particular motion) and transmits a resulting impulse (as for measurement or operating a control)” “An actuator is a mechanical device for moving or controlling something . ” Source: Merriam - Webster (2019)
Digital Sensors°30   Source: Merriam - Webster (2019)  An analog  sensor measures continuously the variable  and detects any proportional  value between 100%  and 0%.  For this reason ,  the measure provided by the analog  sensor is more precise than the one provided by the digital  sensor .  à infinite  set of possible values  A digital  sensor only detects two possible status :  if it is working at  100%  or at 0%.  à finite  set of possible values ( One - Zero)

Hints for selecting Wireless Technologies°45  • Which latency can your application tolarate ? • Is your application mobile (e. g. a  moving device )?  Does your application have to work on multiple  continents ? • How cost sensitive  is your application ? • Does the transmission technology have to ubiquitously available ? • Can  you cope with a  vendor lock - in ?
